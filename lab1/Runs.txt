This is a file describing the input used to test
my implementation of a discrete event simulation.

for the first test run i chose the following initial data

SEED 234324
INIT_TIME 600  // some arbitrary start time not 0 to test programs ability to deal with that
FIN_TIME 10000 // time of 10,000 seem like enough time to finish at least 100 jobs
ARRIVE_MIN 1   // a job can come  at almost any time
ARRIVE_MAX 100 // and but wont wait longer than 100 turns
QUIT_PROB .2   // the probability a program quits  after done with CPU
CPU_MIN 1      // this is the fast processing time because modern CPU are the fast component on the computer
CPU_MAX 10     // choose a multiple of 10
DISK1_MIN 10    // this will simulate a register which is 10 * slower than the CPU
DISK1_MAX 100   // this will simulate a register which is 10 * slower than the CPU
DISK2_MIN 100   // this will simulate a DISK on memory which is 100 * slower than the CPU
DISK2_MAX 1000  // this will simulate a DISK on memory is 100 * slower than the CPU

This run all my stats looked good my utilization was over 80% across the board

// next i increase the time jobs take to arrive

SEED 2342544234
INIT_TIME 600
FIN_TIME 10000
ARRIVE_MIN 100
ARRIVE_MAX 1000
QUIT_PROB .5		//increase quit time
CPU_MIN 1
CPU_MAX 10
DISK1_MIN 10
DISK1_MAX 100
DISK2_MIN 100
DISK2_MAX 1000

After this run we see a major hit on devices actually being used. as we would expect 
from increase wait times 

I can conclude from this, that quicker service time will increase utilization of the given module.

CPU Utilization: 0.326754.2%
Disk1 Utilization: 0.548333.2%
Disk2 Utilization: 0.631930.2%
